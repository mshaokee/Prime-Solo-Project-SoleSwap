# SOLE SWAP

## Description

Duration: We had two weeks to work on this project.

Soleswap is a web application that allows users to connect and create posts whether they are looking to buy, sell or trade their shoes. In the shoe world it's about collecting and re-selling shoes. Certain shoes are released in limited amounts giving them high value. There are many 3rd party applications that do transactions but have issues with whether the shoes are authentic or not. With Soleswap, the users can contact each other in their own means which means the trust can be built from one person to another.
